                            <p>The first intervention in the wedding as a musician is in the part of the ceremony, with the walk down the aisle of the bride and groom. Would you like a modern song or a wedding classic? For couples who prefer the modern, the music of Ed Sheeran is one of the most requested, while in traditional ceremonies a Canon by Pachelbel or Wagner's Wedding March are the benchmarks.</p>

                            <p>Consult my entire repertoire, get ideas of what songs you would like for each moment of the Ceremony, if you do not find your favorite song, let me know, it will not be a problem to learn it for your wedding.</p>

                            <p>You can also find many of my videos searching SAXONARA on YouTube or Instagram, listen to my saxophone versions and imagine how it would sound on your wedding day.</p>

                            <p>Mix of music and entertainment, the Reception or Aperitif is an excellent moment to enjoy live music with saxophone, with a Tropical House repertoire in the purest Ibiza style and entertaining moving around the area with a wireless microphone on my saxophone.</p>

                            <p>In addition, we will prepare, if the bride and groom so wish, a spectacular entrance to the Aperitif with very explosive music to make it incredible, walking among the guests and dancing with those who are most willing.</p>

                            <p>Showing up by surprise after the First Dance or at the End of the Banquet, with LED lights on the saxophone and an explosive musical style, that's how I like to start the party with the DJ, by surprise and with energy!</p>

                            <p>My versatility on the saxophone allows me to adapt to each type of event, so the Open Bar is an excellent option to bring out the funkiest sound on the saxophone and cheer up on the dance floor with the most modern music and also those Disco music classics.</p>

                            <p>For these moments I love using my saxophone with LED lights, offering a more colorful and spectacular show, which makes this final moment of your wedding celebration shine to the fullest.</p>

                            <p>I work with different DJs and I also adapt to the one you may already have booked, being in constant communication, providing them with my music so they can mix it and even improvising along with their mixes on the dance floor. I can advise you on DJs I know. Let the party begin!</p>

Here are other ideas, other than the main services, that some couples have requested throughout my career:</p>

                                <p class="doing-text">I remember once where I appeared at the end of the dinner, by surprise, from the balcony at an old venue, with all the guests who were finishing dinner below, it was spectacular. I performed three songs, one from the balcony, another going down with the guests and the third taking everyone, doing the conga, to the party area. Of course, I followed playing with the DJ.</p>

                                <p class="doing-text">There are two main options for this time, one is to create a jazzy-modern atmosphere, in the background, with saxophone music accompanied by guitar, piano or tracks, or I can perform 2 or 3 sets during dinner, with explosive music to create a party atmosphere, even coordinating it with the gifts or the entrance of the bride and groom.</p>
