                <p>This summer I had the pleasure of performing at a truly magical wedding at <strong>Château de Caumont</strong>, a beautiful 16th-century castle located in the heart of southern France (Cazaux-Savès, Gers).</p>
<p>The celebration took place on a warm July evening, bathed in golden light and surrounded by <strong>gardens</strong>, <strong>history </strong>and pure <strong>elegance</strong>. The atmosphere couldn’t have been more perfect for music and joy.</p>
<p>For the aperitif, I performed my<strong> Ibiza-style DJ&amp;SAX live set</strong>, blending chill house, pop and Balearic vibes while walking among the guests with my saxophone. The music created a <strong>relaxed and elegant </strong>mood as people sipped champagne and admired the sunset over the château.</p>
<p><br>Later, as the night came alive, <strong>I joined the DJ on the dancefloor</strong>, playing live saxophone over a selection of <strong>disco anthems</strong>, <strong>electronic hits </strong>and <strong>timeless classics</strong>. From Earth, Wind &amp; Fire to David Guetta, we kept everyone dancing with perfect synergy, blending live improvisation with high-energy beats.</p>
<p>🎥 In the video below, you can see some beautiful moments from this wedding: the venue, the setup, the guests — and also hear me <strong>warming up on tenor saxophone</strong>, playing delicate arpeggios in the château’s resonant acoustic, just before the celebration began.</p>

<p>It was a joy to be part of such a stunning day in an extraordinary location. I love what I do, and moments like this remind me why.</p>

<p data-start="574" data-end="804">The day began in spectacular fashion — the couple made a grand entrance by <strong data-start="649" data-end="663">helicopter</strong>, arriving from their ceremony held in a beautiful church in the heart of <strong data-start="737" data-end="755">Barcelona city</strong>.

<p data-start="1106" data-end="1304">The vibe was absolutely electric, a perfect mix of elegance and fun. This performance is the perfect example of how <strong data-start="1222" data-end="1303">live saxophone music can transform a wedding meal into an unforgettable party</strong>.</p>

<p data-start="608" data-end="927">The venue has a stunning Mediterranean charm — white façades, vintage touches, palm trees, and that timeless Sitges energy. A perfect blend of <strong data-start="751" data-end="790">elegance and Ibiza-style atmosphere</strong>, ideal for couples planning a <strong data-start="821" data-end="853">destination wedding in Spain</strong> or even a summer getaway (yes, the venue is also available for holidays).</p>
<p data-start="929" data-end="1059">🎥 In this VLOG, you can see the energy and flow of the wedding day from my perspective as a <strong data-start="1022" data-end="1058">live saxophonist and entertainer</strong>.</p>

<h3 data-start="1066" data-end="1125">🎷 My Performance: From Elegant Banquet to Sunset Party</h3>
<p data-start="1127" data-end="1382">I began by <strong data-start="1138" data-end="1190">surprising the guests during the wedding banquet</strong>, performing live saxophone between courses. The highlight? Leading the entire group to the party zone with my version of <strong data-start="1312" data-end="1336">“Jubel” by Klingande</strong> — a classic that never fails to create magic.</p>
<p data-start="1384" data-end="1591">Once everyone gathered by the <strong data-start="1414" data-end="1422">pool</strong>, the party truly came alive. Together with the DJ, I performed live saxophone over a dynamic and uplifting set of <strong data-start="1537" data-end="1579">electronic, disco and chill-house hits</strong>, including:</p>
<ul>
<li data-start="1639" data-end="1679">
<p data-start="1641" data-end="1679"><strong>“Destination Calabria” – Alex Gaudino</strong></p>

<li><strong data-start="1641" data-end="1677">“September” – Earth, Wind &amp; Fire</strong></li>
<li><strong data-start="1682" data-end="1713">“No Man No Cry” – Jimmy Sax</strong></li>
<li data-start="1680" data-end="1715"><strong data-start="1718" data-end="1764">“Infinity” – Jaymes Young (SAXONARA remix)</strong></li>
<li><strong data-start="1769" data-end="1799">“Freed from Desire” – Gala</strong></li>
</ul>
<p data-start="1801" data-end="1951">The poolside vibe, the sunset light and the energy from the guests created an unforgettable Ibiza-style celebration — right in the heart of Catalonia.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for <strong data-start="2056" data-end="2085">live music with saxophone</strong>, elegant but fun, that blends perfectly with your <strong data-start="2136" data-end="2176">wedding aperitif, dinner or DJ party</strong>, I’d love to be part of your day.</p>
<p data-start="2034" data-end="2366">Based in <strong data-start="2222" data-end="2235">Barcelona</strong>, I perform regularly in <strong data-start="2260" data-end="2297">Spain, Ibiza, Mallorca and France</strong>, and I specialize in destination weddings with international guests.</p>
