                            <p class="section-subtext">Spanish guitar can play many music styles, and can be played in different adaptations and have a very wide repertoire with just the guitar and its <strong>flamenco</strong> strumming. However, the music can also be taken to more <strong>Bossa Nova</strong> and traditional styles.</p>

                            <p class="section-subtext">A <strong>cocktail atmosphere with Spanish guitar music</strong> usually includes basic sound (a set of one or two speakers) that allows the music to spread throughout the space.</p>

                            <p class="section-subtext">The repertoire will be prepared together with the client, who can give ideas on where to take the musical style.</p>

                            <p class="section-subtext"><strong>Solo Spanish guitarist</strong> performances are usually instrumental, but vocals can be included at the client's request.</p>

                            <p class="section-subtext">The option of including saxophone in the Spanish guitar show is always highly recommended as it gives a much brighter and more surprising touch to the performance, a unique characteristic of my show and versatility.</p>
