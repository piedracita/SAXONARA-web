                        <p>Modern Pop, when performed on the saxophone, gains a sophistication that makes it <strong>ideal for the cocktail hour</strong>. This selection transforms the hits we all know into an <strong>elegant and classy soundtrack</strong>. It's the perfect atmosphere for the <strong>Wedding Cocktail Hour</strong>, serving as the ideal transition between the solemnity of the ceremony and the party; or for <strong>Corporate Events</strong>, on modern terraces, presentations, or company receptions that seek discreet background music with a high artistic level.</p>

                        <p>With my saxophone, I lead the main melody, creating a relaxed musical background that pairs perfectly with the first Gin Tonic, Vermouth, or Champagne. Moreover, my greatest motivation is to make your event unique: I thoroughly <b>adapt the repertoire</b> to the client's taste and I am always open to musical <b>requests</b>. If your favorite song is not on the playlist, let me know. Learning new songs is my best fuel!</p>
