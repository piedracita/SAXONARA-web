                        <p class="about-singer-text">My experience allows me <b>to adapt to different events and parties</b>, playing styles such as <b>Tropical House, Smooth Pop</b> and improvising with DJs and <strong>LED lights on my saxophone</strong>.</p>
                        <p class="about-singer-text">I have a <b>large repertoire</b> that will help you get ideas, I'm also <b>open to requests</b>, especially at weddings.</p>
                        <p class="about-singer-text">To choose carefully <strong>the appropriate dress code</strong> is as important as the music, so I will present myself dressed in an <strong>elegant</strong> way or according to the situation, send me your thoughts!</p>
