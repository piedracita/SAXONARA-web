                            <p><b>My name is Arnald SAXONARA, I am a musician and saxophonist at events, weddings and playing concerts, below I tell you about my career</b></p>
                            <p>I was born in 1990 ðŸ‘¶ and began my music studies when I was 7 years old, initially playing the <b>piano ðŸŽ¹</b> and following the formal training of the regular Music Schools. As time went by, and as my music tastes evolved, I put aside the piano to focus on the study of <b>modern music</b>, this time as a <b>guitarist ðŸŽ¸</b> and already participating in bands and playing live. A few years later, as a teenager, I started with the <b>saxophone ðŸŽ·</b> as a second instrument, but it quickly took center stage, relegating the guitar to the background. It is with the saxophone that I do my studies at the <b>Conservatory</b>.</p>
                            <p>Along with my music studies I also graduated in <b>Business Administration and Management ðŸ“ˆ</b> from the <b>University of Lleida</b> (Spain) and Center College, Kentucky, <b>United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸</b>, where I studied a mix of subjects in liberal education ranging from Jazz and Music to Finance and Economics.</p>
                            <p>In 2013 I returned <b>from the United States to Europe</b>, it was a time of readaptation, where I joined as a saxophonist in funk-disco, rockabilly and jazz bands, always restless to play and learn from <b>different styles</b>, and looking for a way to book my projects at concerts and events. At this time I also continued my training as a musician in academies.</p>
                            <p>Already in 2015 I moved to <b>Puerto Rico ðŸ‡µðŸ‡·</b>, settling in its capital, San Juan. It is there where I begin to become familiar with all the traditional music of the country, specially Salsa, Bomba, Rumba and Plena. In Puerto Rico I formed my group with musicians from the <b>Puerto Rico Conservatory of Music</b>, performing in such iconic places as the stage in the La Perla neighborhood, in Old San Juan, the same stage where the legendary Puerto Rican band Calle 13 performed after being awarded with Latin Grammy awards.</p>
                            <p>Upon returning from Puerto Rico, and after a brief lethargy in <b>Argentina ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·</b>, I settled back in Europe and started <b>SAXONARA</b>, my biggest project so far and to which I dedicate all my time and energy.</p>
