                        <p class="doing-text">Sometimes, the key to an <b>unforgettable moment</b> is surprise. The sax not only creates ambience, but it can star in <strong>a triumphant entrance</strong>!<br>
                            I recall, for example, an occasion where my <strong>appearance at the end of the banquet</strong> was totally unexpected: I performed the first track <strong>from the balcony of the estate</strong> before all the guests, generating an immediate wow effect. Then, I walked down among the tables playing a second track and culminated by leading everyone present in <b>a festive conga line</b> to the open bar area.</p>

                             <strong> - Sophisticated Background</strong>: A soft and <b>elegant ambience</b> (Jazz, Bossa, or Lounge), with saxophone and backing tracks or DJ mixes, to discreetly accompany conversation.</p>

                            I prepare the music <b>upon request</b> of the couple, creating a personalized track with the exact duration you need. This allows you to prepare your choreography or special moment, and when it ends, <b>the DJ & Sax energy immediately kicks off the open bar</b>!</p>
