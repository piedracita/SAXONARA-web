        <p class="banner-highlight">My work as a <strong>professional saxophonist</strong> is based on total adaptability. I don't offer a single style, but a <b>complete sound palette</b> designed to evolve with the different moments of your event and ensure that the atmosphere is always perfect, from the first to the last moment.</p>
        <p class="banner-highlight">My repertoire is extensive and carefully segmented to cover every need: from the most emotive ballads for the <strong>Wedding Ceremony</strong>, to a <strong>Lounge and Chill House</strong> style ideal for the <strong>Cocktail Hour or Aperitif</strong>. And if what you are looking for is maximum energy, my star format is Disco, Funk, and Dance alongside a DJ, perfect for the <strong>Open Bar</strong> and the party. No matter the atmosphere you seek, I have the perfect soundtrack for the exact moment.</p>
