                <p>This summer I had the pleasure of performing at a truly magical wedding at <strong>Ch√¢teau de Caumont</strong>, a beautiful 16th-century castle located in the heart of southern France (Cazaux-Sav√®s, Gers).</p>
<p>The celebration took place on a warm July evening, bathed in golden light and surrounded by <strong>gardens</strong>, <strong>history </strong>and pure <strong>elegance</strong>. The atmosphere couldn‚Äôt have been more perfect for music and joy.</p>
<p>For the aperitif, I performed my<strong> Ibiza-style DJ&amp;SAX live set</strong>, blending chill house, pop and Balearic vibes while walking among the guests with my saxophone. The music created a <strong>relaxed and elegant </strong>mood as people sipped champagne and admired the sunset over the ch√¢teau.</p>
<p><br>Later, as the night came alive, <strong>I joined the DJ on the dancefloor</strong>, playing live saxophone over a selection of <strong>disco anthems</strong>, <strong>electronic hits </strong>and <strong>timeless classics</strong>. From Earth, Wind &amp; Fire to David Guetta, we kept everyone dancing with perfect synergy, blending live improvisation with high-energy beats.</p>
<p>üé• In the video below, you can see some beautiful moments from this wedding: the venue, the setup, the guests ‚Äî and also hear me <strong>warming up on tenor saxophone</strong>, playing delicate arpeggios in the ch√¢teau‚Äôs resonant acoustic, just before the celebration began.</p>
