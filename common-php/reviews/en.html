                            <blockquote>Arnald was <strong>fantastic to work with when we planned our wedding in Girona</strong> this May. He was friendly and quick to respond to emails, had a <strong>great existing selection of music</strong> to choose from, and also very kindly agreed to <strong>play some songs we had requested</strong>, which he learned especially for our wedding! We couldnâ€™t have been happier with our decision to have Arnald play the music for us <strong>walking down the aisle, during the ceremony, aperitif and the evening meal</strong>. Our guests were so <strong>impressed</strong> with him and he was a perfect addition to our big day. We could not recommend him more!!!</blockquote>
