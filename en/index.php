                            <p class="section-subtext">Hello! I'm Arnald SAXONARA, I'm a <strong>professional saxophonist at events and weddings</strong> playing as a solo artist, along with DJs, bands or other options. I love playing <strong><a href="/en/saxophonist-wedding.php">live music at weddings</a></strong>, private events, hotels, parties, <strong>corporate events</strong> & more.</p>

                            <p class="section-subtext"><b>Where can you find me?</b> I travel and play my music as a <strong>saxophonist throughout Europe</strong>, specially you can find me in <a href="/en/saxophonist-barcelona.php">Barcelona</a>, <a href="/en/saxophonist-madrid.php">Madrid</a> or around <a href="/en/saxophonist-spain.php">Spain</a>. I also work, specially in summer in <a href="/en/saxophonist-mallorca.php">Mallorca</a>, and private events and weddings in the UK, France, Germany, Switzerland and Dubai.</p>

                            <p class="section-subtext"><b>My favorite styles?</b> I adapt my shows to each event, so playing <strong>romantic music on saxophone</strong> at a <a href="/en/saxophonist-wedding.php#ceremony">Wedding Ceremony</a> is not going to be the same as playing my <strong>saxophone with LED lights</strong> on the stage of a nightclub. I love to adapt to each event, in an <strong>elegant</strong> way and seeking to satisfy the client, so I'm also open to <b>requests</b> to make the event unique.</p>

                            <p class="section-subtext">In addition to music, I also have <b>sound equipment and microphones</b> for the ease of the customer. Contact me to book the date of your event. I travel throughout <strong>Spain</strong>, <strong>France</strong>, <strong>UK</strong>, <strong>Germany</strong> and abroad.</p>

                            <h5>Corporate Events</h5>
                            <p>At <strong>Business / Corporate Events</strong> I usually work <strong>playing smooth saxophone</strong> and moving around different styles like Smooth Pop or Deep House, creating a <strong>Modern Chill-Out atmosphere</strong> at times like After-Office, Team Building or similar, this is a usual request at rooftops in large cities like <strong>London Barcelona or Paris</strong>.</p>
                            <h5>Sound equipment</h5>
